Unofficial Heroku buildpack: Python + npm dependency resolution
========================

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for Python apps.
It uses [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) and [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/).

Differences
-----------

The main difference from the official Python buildpack is support for node dependencies via [npm](http://npmjs.org).

This is accomplished via an `npm_requirements.txt` which must be in the base directory (along with the `requirements.txt` file that is used by pip)

If an `npm_requirements.txt` file is present it works similar to the way you're used to with pip.

Each line of the file is appended to `npm install` so for example

npm_requirements.txt:

    coffee-script
    less@1.0.0
    
would result in the following commands being run to resolve the dependencies:

    $ npm install -g coffee-script
    $ npm install -g less@1.0.0
    
Why install Node along with Python?
-----------------------------------

Primarily because it's desirable to use technologies like [less-css](http://lesscss.org/) and [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) on the server (with something like [django compressor](https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor) for example)

Usage
-----

Example usage:

    $ ls
    Procfile  requirements.txt  web.py

    $ heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack git@github.com:jiaaro/heroku-buildpack-django.git

    $ git push heroku master
    ...

    -----> Python app detected
    -----> Preparing virtualenv version 1.6.4

           Installing setuptools............done.
           Installing pip...............done.
    -----> Installing dependencies using pip version 1.0.2

           Downloading/unpacking Werkzeug>=0.6.1 (from Flask==0.7.2->-r requirements.txt (line 1))
           Downloading/unpacking Jinja2>=2.4 (from Flask==0.7.2->-r requirements.txt (line 1))
           Installing collected packages: Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja2
           Successfully installed Flask Werkzeug Jinja2
           Cleaning up...

The buildpack will detect your app as Python if it has the file `requirements.txt` in the root. It will detect your app as Python/Django if there is an additional `settings.py` in a project subdirectory.

It will use virtualenv and pip to install your dependencies, vendoring a copy of the Python runtime into your slug.  The `bin/`, `include/` and `lib/` directories will be cached between builds to allow for faster pip install time.

Hacking
-------

To use this buildpack, fork it on Github.  Push up changes to your fork, then create a test app with `--buildpack <your-github-url>` and push to it.

To change the vendored virtualenv, unpack the desired version to the `src/` folder, and update the virtualenv() function in `bin/compile` to prepend the virtualenv module directory to the path. The virtualenv release vendors its own versions of pip and setuptools.

Changing Buildpacks
-------------------

If you've already deployed an app to heroku and you'd like to switch to this buildpack from the standard python buildpack, just run the following command with the heroku command line app:

    heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=git://github.com/jiaaro/heroku-buildpack-django.git
